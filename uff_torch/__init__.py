"""PyTorch implementation of the Universal Force Field (UFF).

This package provides utilities to convert an RDKit ``Mol`` object into
tensor representations and a differentiable, GPU-aware ``torch.nn.Module``
that evaluates the bonded and non-bonded energy terms of the Universal
Force Field.  The implementation mirrors the reference RDKit implementation
while exposing vectorised PyTorch kernels so that energies and forces can be
computed with autograd.
